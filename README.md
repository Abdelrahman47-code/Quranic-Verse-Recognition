📝 Overview
This tool allows users to record audio of a Quranic verse, which is then processed to identify the Surah and Ayah (verse) number. It uses the ["tarteel-ai/whisper-tiny-ar-quran"](https://huggingface.co/tarteel-ai/whisper-tiny-ar-quran) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for the recognition process.

📦 Features
- Real-Time Audio Recording 🎤: Capture and process audio recordings instantly.
- AI-Powered Verse Recognition 🧠: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to identify Quranic verses accurately.
- User-Friendly Interface 🌐: Built with Tkinter, providing a seamless and interactive experience.
- Extensive Database 📜: Includes JSON files for all Surahs and Ayahs for comprehensive verse recognition.
- Text-to-Speech 🔈: Reads out the identified verse using pyttsx3.

🌟 How It Works
- Load Model and Processor: Initializes the Whisper model and processor for Arabic Quranic text.
- Record and Process Audio: Records user's audio input and processes it using the AI model.
- Identify Verse: Matches the processed audio to the closest Quranic verse using JSON files.
- Output: Displays the identified Surah and Ayah, and reads it out loud.

📋 JSON Files
- The tool uses a structured format for Quranic verses stored in JSON files. Each Surah's Text that you can get from [here](https://www.equran.org/) is mapped to a corresponding JSON file containing its Ayahs.
